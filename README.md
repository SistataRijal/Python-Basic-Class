So, to get started with GitHub we will be needing to create a new repository or the project. Here is the step-by-step instructions on how to install any dependencies or set up the project.  
Step-1 : Open GitHub and login to your account.    
Step-2 : At the top of the site you will be seeing a + icon like this one.

Step-3 : Click the icon and then click on New repository.  
Step-4 : Add a name to your repository and ive description if you want to.  
Step-5 : Click on the public icon to make your reposiory visible to all.
Step-6 : After that, Click on the **ADD A README FILE** option to create a readme file and choose the license that you want to work with.I sugest to choose MIT.Here's how it should look like

***  
And now that you have created a repository, you can use it to store your codes, share them amon others who are still learning or want to hav a look and collaborate with others and get feedbacks.

Others can also contribute to your repository by forking them or directly collaborating with you, makin chanes to your repository, making commits, etc. 
To fork any repository we need to simply clickin on the fork symbol like this one and again clicking on create fork.
